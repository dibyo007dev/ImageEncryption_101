Image EncrYption Image EncrYption using - Block Based Symmetric Transformation Algorithm 

This project deals with image security concerns over the internet . A simple algo which will encrypt and decrypt a “.jpeg” file with least entropy possible.

Profit : Image transfer over the internet now a days is not at all safe , as many image processing tools are available which can deduce many things from just a simple image . This will help us for getting our
